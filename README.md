# Main Key Points
In this dashobard firsty I had displaiyed the region using slicers. Then I created the KPI's cards on the basis of total orders, total sales, total profit and average ship time or we can say average ship days. Then I used a map to present intractive and impactfull dashboard. Then I use cluster bar chart to present the category on the basis of sales, top 3 sub category on the basis of sales and ship method on the basis of sales. Then I used area area chart on the basis of sales based on order date then again I used the area chart for presenting the profit on the basis of sales based on order date. Then I used donut chart the present the Customer segment, Region and payment mode. After I did the forecasting using line chart and shows the data of sales using order date and I used zoom slider for better understanding. Then again I used the cluster bar chart to present the list of top 10 performing states according to the sales.That's all about this intractive dashboard.
